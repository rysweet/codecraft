 # Rough Sketch
 
-_TODO: describe your idea here._
+The “Rough Sketch” is meant to help project teams quickly visualize and iterate on early-stage ideas—whether it’s mapping user journeys, scoping basic features, or planning system flows—without committing to high-fidelity details.
+The core objective is to give stakeholders a lightweight, shared artifact they can interact with in real time, ensuring everyone’s on the same page about the project’s high-level structure before moving into detailed design or development.
