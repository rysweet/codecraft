Pathway to Self-Improving Software

1. Context: Vibe Coding’s Trajectory

Today Vibe Coding is successfully shifting from ad-hoc feature delivery toward reliable, methodical, specification-driven development.  Specs now sit at the center of every task, informing test cases and shaping implementation plans.  This rigor is an essential waypoint, yet it is not the destination.  The real opportunity is to evolve specifications—and the software they describe—into living systems that understand themselves and adapt continuously.

2. The Ambition: Software That Reflects, Learns, and Improves

Imagine programs that can notice friction in their own user experience, reason about design trade-offs, and collaborate with people to iterate.  In other words, software whose inner loop is Design Thinking itself: empathize ▶︎ define ▶︎ ideate ▶︎ prototype ▶︎ test ▶︎ refine—on repeat, forever.

To reach that horizon we need two foundational capabilities:
	1.	A Code Understanding Engine that maintains a richly-linked, canonical representation of everything the system is and does.
	2.	A Semi-Autonomous Multi-Agent Ecosystem trained to traverse that representation and execute the Design Thinking loop at scale.

3. Canonical Knowledge Graph as System Backbone

Traditional source code is a point-in-time artifact.  Instead, we propose treating a family of interwoven graphs as the single source of truth:
	•	Intent Graph — goals extracted from specs, user stories, issue threads, and commit messages.
	•	AST & Symbol Graphs — structural and binding relationships inside every file.
	•	Execution Graph — runtime call stacks, control-flow edges, and performance traces.
	•	Data-Flow Graph — lineage of values across functions, services, and storage.
	•	Usage Graph — real user journeys, telemetry, and edge-case patterns.
	•	Documentation Graph — API docs, diagrams, READMEs, onboarding guides.

Viewed together, these layers form a holistic map of the product.  The map updates continuously as code evolves, deployments roll out, and users interact.

4. Code Understanding Engine

The engine ingests repositories, build artifacts, logs, and live traffic, then synchronizes each layer of the graph.  On top of this substrate we expose:
	•	Declarative Queries (e.g., “where does user-provided PII flow after upload?”).
	•	Diff-Aware Views for comparing graph snapshots across commits or releases.
	•	Embeddings & Vector Search so agents and people can ask natural-language questions.

This makes the graph actionable—not merely documentation but an execution surface for reasoning, planning, and automated change.

5. Multi-Agent Design Thinking Loop

We orchestrate a caste of specialized agents, each owning a phase of Design Thinking:

Phase	Agent	Core Responsibilities
Empathize	User-Insight Agent	Mine usage graph, conduct surveys, surface pain points.
Define	Product-Sense Agent	Translate insights into problem statements and success metrics.
Ideate	Architect Agent	Explore solution space, reference knowledge graph for constraints.
Prototype	Implementation Agent	Generate patches, tests, and docs; open draft PRs.
Test	QA Agent	Simulate scenarios, validate acceptance criteria, update coverage.
Iterate	Reflection Agent	Compare outcomes to metrics, decide next experiments or ship.

Each agent can spawn task-focused sub-agents (e.g., security, performance, accessibility) while sharing a common situational awareness through the graph.

6. Roadmap to Self-Improvement

Phase 0 — Consolidate Spec-Driven Development (Now - Q3 2025)
	•	Finalize spec templates, enforce CI gates, embed traceability links into commits.

Phase 1 — Build the Unified Code Graph (Q4 2025)
	•	Ship ingestion pipelines for AST & symbol graphs.
	•	Integrate OpenTelemetry spans to seed execution and data-flow layers.

Phase 2 — Augment with Usage Telemetry (Q1 2026)
	•	Anonymize and stream frontend/back-end events into the graph.
	•	Launch initial natural-language query console.

Phase 3 — Deploy the First Multi-Agent Loop (Q2-Q3 2026)
	•	Roll out User-Insight, Product-Sense, and Implementation agents on low-risk services.
	•	Measure end-to-end cycle time and quality deltas vs. human-only teams.

Phase 4 — Self-Improving Release Pipeline (Q4 2026)
	•	Expand agents to production repositories; enable autonomous merge within guardrails.
	•	Introduce Reflection Agent to decide when to cut releases or roll back.

Phase 5 — Emergent Co-Creativity with Users (2027+)
	•	Expose conversational interface where the product and its users co-design new capabilities.

7. Practical Considerations
	•	Toolchain Compatibility — adopt language-server protocols and repo-host agnostic ingest.
	•	Data Hygiene & Privacy — rigorous anonymization, retention policies, differential privacy.
	•	Observability — treat agents as first-class services with logs, metrics, and tracing.
	•	Governance — gated autonomy, policy compliance, human-in-the-loop escalation.

8. Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Model hallucination	Faulty code changes	Ensemble agent voting, graph-based fact-checking.
Autonomy drift	Unintended feature creep	Policy constraints, runtime kill-switches.
Privacy leakage	Regulatory violation	Strict data-flow audit, opt-in telemetry.
IP contamination	License conflicts	SPDX scanning integrated into graph ingest.

9. Metrics of Progress
	•	Graph Completeness Score
	•	Agent Intervention Success Rate
	•	Mean Time-to-Feature (MTTF)
	•	User Satisfaction Trend (qual + quant)

10. Immediate Next Steps
	1.	Ratify this pathway with engineering leadership.
	2.	Prototype AST + symbol graph ingest on a representative microservice.
	3.	Draft RFC for telemetry schema feeding the usage graph.
	4.	Stand-up spike of User-Insight1. Define Coverage Dimensions per Layer  
   • AST layer: Ratio of discovered syntax elements (classes, functions, calls, etc.) vs. expected total.  
   • Usage telemetry layer: Proportion of monitored usage events (e.g., API calls) vs. total actual events.  
   • Other layers: Identify the relevant nodes (entities) and edges (links), then track the fraction present vs. estimated total.

2. Compute Graph Completeness Score  
   • For each layer, calculate coverage as “Percentage of nodes/edges in the graph that match the known set of possible nodes/edges.”  
   • Weight each layer’s coverage by its importance to yield an overall score (e.g., 40% AST, 30% usage, 30% domain model).

3. Determine Thresholds and Progression  
   • Set minimum coverage baseline per layer (e.g., 80% AST coverage, 70% usage coverage).  
   • Require crossing these baselines and maintaining them over multiple cycles (e.g., three successive sprints).  
   • Once thresholds are met, transition to the next phase of autonomy (e.g., automated analysis or code generation).

+2) Migration: When new merge rules are introduced (v3, v4, etc.), the system can retain older rules. Only clients explicitly requesting the newer version receive it—thus preserving backward compatibility.  
+3) Validation: Enforce regression tests against the older policy versions. Validate policy syntax and semantics in a CI pipeline (e.g., run test merges with real data) so changes do not degrade existing behavior.  
+4) Evolution Strategy: Over time, remove outdated policy versions only when suitable adoption metrics are met or after providing a well-communicated EOL window to clients.

+### 9.2. Coverage Aggregator
+
+A practical way to unify coverage metrics is to introduce a dedicated “coverage aggregator” service or library that all microservices report into. The aggregator enforces a common schema (e.g., containing telemetry, AST completeness, etc.) and timestamps for each service’s coverage metrics. It periodically composes these partial metrics into an overall Graph Completeness Score.
+
+When a microservice lags or has incomplete coverage data, the aggregator can do one of two things:
+• Use the last known coverage data from that service, marking its status as “stale” and degrading the overall score accordingly.  
+• Mark any new coverage for that service as “partial” if it meets a minimum threshold, ensuring the product-level score reflects partial progress rather than dropping coverage to zero.
+
+A simple weighting algorithm can grant certain services bigger influence on the total (if they’re critical) while accommodating partial coverage from others. For example, define numeric weights for each service, multiply its reported coverage ratio by its weight, then sum across all services and normalize. Stale or missing data reduces coverage proportionally.
+
+By storing incoming reports in a small versioned index (e.g., an append-only table keyed by microservice + report timestamp), the aggregator can:
+• Track coverage deltas over time.  
+• Trigger alerts if critical microservices fall behind.  
+• Feed a visualization tool to show overall and per-service scores.
+
+Thus, the coverage aggregator becomes the single source of truth for the evolving, multi-service coverage view, gracefully handling partial or delayed results while still surfacing a unified product-level metric.

+### 9.2. Coverage Aggregator
+
+A practical way to unify coverage metrics is to introduce a dedicated “coverage aggregator” service or library that all microservices report into. The aggregator enforces a common schema (e.g., containing telemetry, AST completeness, etc.) and timestamps for each service’s coverage metrics. It periodically composes these partial metrics into an overall Graph Completeness Score.
+
+When a microservice lags or has incomplete coverage data, the aggregator can do one of two things:
+• Use the last known coverage data from that service, marking its status as “stale” and degrading the overall score accordingly.  
+• Mark any new coverage for that service as “partial” if it meets a minimum threshold, ensuring the product-level score reflects partial progress rather than dropping coverage to zero.
+
+A simple weighting algorithm can grant certain services bigger influence on the total (if they’re critical) while accommodating partial coverage from others. For example, define numeric weights for each service, multiply its reported coverage ratio by its weight, then sum across all services and normalize. Stale or missing data reduces coverage proportionally.
+
+By storing incoming reports in a small versioned index (e.g., an append-only table keyed by microservice + report timestamp), the aggregator can:
+• Track coverage deltas over time.  
+• Trigger alerts if critical microservices fall behind.  
+• Feed a visualization tool to show overall and per-service scores.

+Thus, the coverage aggregator becomes the single source of truth for the evolving, multi-service coverage view, gracefully handling partial or delayed results while still surfacing a unified product-level metric.
