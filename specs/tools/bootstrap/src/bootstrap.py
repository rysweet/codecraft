Rough Sketch:
The main challenges revolve around:
  • Eliminating inefficient back-and-forth: 
    Users need a streamlined way to gather inputs quickly, 
    without manual data-siloed tasks.
  • Reducing cognitive load: 
    The design should minimize complex workflows or guesswork 
    that bog down users or confuse stakeholders.
  • Providing immediate insights: 
    There’s a gap in timely, context-rich feedback.

This module addresses these challenges by offering functions to:
  1. Initialize a configurable environment.
  2. Gather and consolidate user inputs seamlessly.
  3. Reduce cognitive overhead through efficient data processing.
  4. Provide immediate, context-rich insights to stakeholders.
