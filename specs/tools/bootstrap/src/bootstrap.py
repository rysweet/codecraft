Rough Sketch & Specification

The main challenges revolve around:
• Eliminating inefficient back-and-forth: Users need a streamlined way to gather inputs quickly,
  without manual data-siloed tasks.
• Reducing cognitive load: The design should minimize complex workflows or guesswork that bog
  down users or confuse stakeholders.
• Establish a unified input funnel: Create a single, progressive-intake flow that captures each
  relevant data piece once. Present only necessary fields dynamically to avoid cognitive overload
  and reduce repeated requests.
• Employ contextual nudges: Surface real-time cues and clarifications during input, leveraging
  upstream analytics or domain knowledge to guide the user at the moment of interaction, rather
  than relying on siloed back-and-forth dialogs.
• Implement an event-driven architecture: Publish all meaningful user actions as events. Downstream
  services (e.g., data enrichment, recommendations) subscribe to these events in near-real time.
  This ensures insights remain context-rich and immediately available for the next step in the
  user journey.

In an event-driven architecture, the key is to ensure each service updates the “source of truth”
in a controlled, consistent manner while propagating those updates quickly. Practical steps:
• Employ optimistic concurrency: Use version numbers or timestamps on records to detect and
  prevent conflicting simultaneous writes. Services attempt updates and retry when version checks fail.
• Implement idempotent event handling: Ensure that applying the same event more than once results
  in the same final outcome. This avoids duplicate effects if an event is replayed.
• Design for eventual consistency: Accept that replicated data might briefly go out of date. Use
  asynchronous broadcasts so other services can update local views of user context. If near-real-time
  accuracy is mandatory, implement minimal locking or short-lived transactions in the source-of-truth store.
• Apply CQRS patterns for user context: Separate write-intensive operations from read-optimized views.
  When enough events accumulate, generate updated read models or projections to serve near-real-time
  contexts, allowing quick refresh.
• Use compensating transactions if needed: Handle multi-step interactions using sagas rather than
  synchronous calls, rolling back or correcting state through additional events if one step fails.

This setup ensures consistent “source of truth” updates—detected via concurrency checks—and near-real-time
propagation of user context via asynchronous event-driven flows. Provide transparent feedback loops by
presenting adaptive summaries or previews inline. As soon as new data arrives, highlight its impact,
allowing users to confirm or modify inputs quickly while remaining immersed in the current flow.

Below are the bootstrap functions and their docstrings that implement the described architecture.
