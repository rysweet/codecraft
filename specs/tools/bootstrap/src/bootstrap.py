bootstrap.py

This module bootstraps the application according to the following specification:

The main challenges revolve around:
• Eliminating inefficient back-and-forth: Users need a streamlined way to gather inputs quickly,
  without manual data-siloed tasks.
• Reducing cognitive load: The design should minimize complex workflows or guesswork that bog down
  users or confuse stakeholders.  
• Establishing a unified input funnel: Create a single, progressive-intake flow that captures each
  relevant data piece once. Present only necessary fields dynamically to avoid cognitive overload
  and reduce repeated requests.
• Employing contextual nudges: Surface real-time cues and clarifications during input, leveraging
  upstream analytics or domain knowledge to guide the user at the moment of interaction, rather than
  relying on siloed back-and-forth dialogs.
• Implementing an event-driven architecture: Publish all meaningful user actions as events.
  Downstream services (e.g., data enrichment, recommendations) subscribe to these events in
  near-real time. This ensures insights remain context-rich and immediately available for the
  next step in the user journey.
• Ensuring consistent “source of truth” updates: Use optimistic concurrency, idempotent event
  handling, and eventual consistency to keep state cohesive across microservices. Apply CQRS
  patterns for user context and leverage compensating transactions if needed.
• Providing transparent feedback loops: Present adaptive summaries or previews inline as soon as
  new data arrives.
• Providing immediate insights: Produce context-rich feedback in real time, highlighting any
  significant impacts or changes.

Additionally, to manage domain data effectively across services, adopt a canonical schema library
strategy:
1) Schema Registry & Versioning:
   - Use a centralized contract registry (e.g., Avro/JSON schemas) with semantic versioning.
   - Enable backward-compatible changes and coexistence of older schema versions if needed.
2) Bounded Context Ownership:
   - Each service owns its portion of the data model, publishing updates to that domain’s data.
3) Progressive Intake & Subscriptions:
   - Keep the canonical schema minimal but extensible; services subscribe to only the fields they need.
4) Evolution & Compatibility:
   - Maintain backward compatibility, employing new major versions only for truly breaking changes.
5) Tooling & Automation:
   - Automate schema deployments and provide self-service subscription and upgrade paths.

This file contains functions that initialize the application, run database migrations, and start
event subscribers for the event-driven architecture.

def initialize_application(config_file: str) -> None:
    """
    Loads the configuration from the given config_file, sets up global
    application state, and prepares any necessary environment variables.

    Steps involved:
    1) Parse configuration (e.g., YAML or JSON) to retrieve relevant settings.
    2) Set up or validate structures needed for a unified input funnel flow.
    3) Initialize concurrency safeguards (e.g., version counters) if configured.
    4) Schedule progressive-intake logic hooks that define the dynamic form fields.
    5) Preload or configure logging, monitoring, and schema registries for event-driven ops.

    :param config_file: Path to the configuration file in the filesystem.

    pass


def run_migrations() -> None:
    """
    Executes database migrations needed for maintaining data schemas or
    versioned domain stores. This ensures the data layer is ready for
    progressive intake and event-driven updates.

    Steps involved:
    1) Connect to the database.
    2) Apply any new migration scripts or version increments.
    3) Verify schemas are compatible with the canonical schema library strategy.
    4) Confirm updates to concurrency frameworks (e.g., version/timestamp columns).
    5) Log success or raise errors on failures.

    # TODO: Replace pass with actual migration logic.
    pass


def start_event_subscribers() -> None:
    """
    Starts the necessary event subscriber loops or threads to consume events
    within the event-driven architecture. These subscribers listen for user
    actions or domain changes, updating the “source of truth” and further
    distributing context to other downstream services.

    Steps involved:
    1) Connect to the event bus or messaging broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
    2) Register each subscriber with the canonical schema library for message parsing.
    3) Initialize concurrency checks (e.g., optimistic concurrency) when processing.
    4) Implement idempotent event handling to avoid duplicate updates.
    5) Forward or store events using CQRS patterns if updates are needed in read models.

    # TODO: Replace pass with actual event-subscription logic.

def main() -> None:
    """
    Main entry point for bootstrapping the service. It performs:
    1) Application initialization by loading configurations.
    2) Database migrations and readiness checks for domain stores.
    3) Startup of event subscribers for the event-driven architecture.

    Eventually, this function can be expanded to include warm-up routines,
    prefetching of domain data, or additional concurrency protection layers
    before handing off to a service loop, HTTP server, or other orchestrated process.
