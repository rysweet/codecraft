The main challenges revolve around:
• Eliminating inefficient back-and-forth: Users need a streamlined way to gather inputs
  quickly, without manual data-siloed tasks.
• Reducing cognitive load: The design should minimize complex workflows or guesswork
  that bog down users or confuse stakeholders.
• Establish a unified input funnel: Create a single, progressive-intake flow that captures
  each relevant data piece once. Present only necessary fields dynamically to avoid cognitive
  overload and reduce repeated requests.
• Employ contextual nudges: Surface real-time cues and clarifications during input,
  leveraging upstream analytics or domain knowledge to guide the user at the moment of
  interaction, rather than relying on siloed back-and-forth dialogs.
• Implement an event-driven architecture: Publish all meaningful user actions as events.
  Downstream services (e.g., data enrichment, recommendations) subscribe to these events
  in near-real time. This ensures insights remain context-rich and immediately available
  for the next step in the user journey.

In an event-driven architecture, the key is to ensure each service updates the “source of
truth” in a controlled, consistent manner while propagating those updates quickly.
Practical steps:
• Employ optimistic concurrency: Use version numbers or timestamps on records to detect
  and prevent conflicting simultaneous writes. Services attempt updates and retry when
  version checks fail.
• Implement idempotent event handling: Ensure that applying the same event more than once
  results in the same final outcome. This avoids duplicate effects if an event is replayed.
• Design for eventual consistency: Accept that replicated data might briefly go out of date.
  Use asynchronous broadcasts so other services can update local views of user context.
  If near-real-time accuracy is mandatory, implement minimal locking or short-lived
  transactions in the source-of-truth store.
• Apply CQRS patterns for user context: Separate write-intensive operations from
  read-optimized views. When enough events accumulate, generate updated read models or
  projections to serve near-real-time contexts, allowing quick refresh.
• Use compensating transactions if needed: Handle multi-step interactions using sagas
  rather than synchronous calls, rolling back or correcting state through additional
  events if one step fails.

This setup ensures consistent “source of truth” updates—detected via concurrency checks—
and near-real-time propagation of user context via asynchronous event-driven flows.

Provide transparent feedback loops: Present adaptive summaries or previews inline. As soon
as new data arrives, highlight its impact, allowing users to confirm or modify inputs quickly
while remaining immersed in the current flow.

## Canonical Schema Library Strategy
One effective strategy is to define a canonical schema library, with each bounded
context (or microservice) owning a portion of that schema. Here’s how you might manage it:

1) Schema Registry & Versioning
• Centralize your data contracts (e.g., Avro/JSON schema registry) to formalize the
  “single source of truth.”
• Use semantic versioning (major/minor/patch) to handle backward-compatible vs. breaking
  changes.
• Allow older schema versions to coexist but encourage an eventual cutoff date for upgrade.

2) Bounded Context Ownership
• Each service owns its slice of the data model. Ownership implies it’s authoritative for
  writing and publishing updates to that data.
• Changes to any domain-owned schema follow a well-defined governance process (e.g.,
  sign-off from a cross-functional architecture board) to prevent unintended impacts.

3) Progressive Intake & Subscriptions
• Keep the canonical schema minimal but extensible: start with only what’s strictly needed
  for the progressive-intake flow.
• Let microservices subscribe to the fields they need. If a service requires additional
  attributes, it proposes an extension to its owned context—another service can piggyback
  if that context attribute is generalizable.

4) Evolution & Compatibility
• Encourage backward compatibility by forbidding destructive changes in minor versions.
  If truly necessary, create a new major version while maintaining the old one until
  dependents migrate.
• Automate schema-change notifications and provide doc-changelogs so consumers know
  exactly what changed.

5) Tooling & Automation
• Automate schema deployments (e.g., code-linting, validations, testing) to minimize errors.
• Provide services with self-serve subscriptions (e.g., a schema query interface) and
  self-upgrade paths (clear version deprecations).

This approach prevents schema bloat, keeps the single source of truth streamlined for
intake needs, and still ensures each service can evolve at the pace its domain requires.

We handle this in three ways:

1. Clear Contract Versioning
   Each service owner must publish changes as a new, backward-compatible version of the
   interface. This ensures existing consumers don’t break while allowing teams to move
   onto the latest schema at their own pace.

2. Automated Governance Checks
   A continuous integration pipeline enforces schema rules (e.g., ensuring required
   fields remain intact). Before merging a pull request, automated tests confirm that no
   existing contract is violated.

3. Time-Boxed Reviews
   Architectural leads perform lightweight, time-boxed reviews on major interface updates
   to catch hidden dependencies or domain-level conflicts. Feedback windows are short
   (e.g., a day or two), preventing long rollout delays while maintaining overall data
   consistency.

This combination of versioning, automated checks, and quick governance reviews ensures
changes move fast without introducing breaking dependencies.
