# Rough Sketch
Here’s a concise flow illustrating how users will engage with the feature end-to-end:

1. Discovery & Launch:
   – User spots a call-to-action (e.g., “Create New …”) on the dashboard or home page.
   – Interest piqued, they click to begin.

2. Preliminary Setup:
   – If required, user signs in or completes a quick registration.
   – Brief introduction explains what the feature does and any preconditions (permissions, data access, etc.).

3. Guided Creation:
   – User is guided through a short wizard or simple form input to gather essential info (titles, settings, or relevant structured data).
   – Auto-validation checks and contextual tips simplify entry.
   – Progress indicator clarifies where they stand in the process.

4. Review & Confirmation:
   – A summary screen previews the result so users can confirm or make edits.
   – Automatic checks highlight any missing or conflicting details.

5. Completion & Next Steps:
   – After confirming, user sees a success page or toast message.
   – Feature-specific calls-to-action (e.g., “Share,” “Add collaborators,” “Start using now”) appear, encouraging immediate engagement.
## Additional Security and Access Control Considerations

1. Define Roles Clearly: Categorize users (e.g., Admin, Project Manager, Contributor) and map each role to its essential privileges during the setup.
2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use a central mechanism to enforce permissions, ensuring only designated roles can initiate or modify preliminary configurations.
3. Enforce Principle of Least Privilege: Limit data access to the minimal level required for each role, preventing unneeded or overly broad rights.
4. Leverage Strong Authentication and Authorization: Combine secure login (e.g., MFA) with token-based or session-based authorization checks at every step of the workflow.
5. Log and Monitor: Capture all access attempts or configuration changes and regularly audit logs to detect and address unauthorized activity early.
• Keep the same step sequence for all roles, but conditionally reveal or hide certain fields and actions for each user type. This ensures a consistent process flow without forcing non-admins to navigate admin-only options.
• Centralize permission checks in one layer (e.g., a permissions service or middleware) that dynamically determines each field’s visibility or mutability based on the user’s current role.
• Provide lightweight visual cues for elevated admin fields (e.g., labeled “Admin Settings”) so the standard flow is not cluttered, but admins clearly see their extra options.
• Use the same underlying flow logic for all roles, but maintain a single place to define role-based business rules—this minimizes branching logic scattered across the UI.
• Ensure any admin-specific steps (e.g., reviewing logs or configuring advanced settings) are inserted where they make logical sense, while regular users proceed seamlessly through their shorter subset of steps.

This approach respects role boundaries (through permission checks and conditional sections) yet maintains a unified step-by-step experience.

 Consider a metadata-driven approach:  
 • Create a central configuration or registry that maps each role to the components, fields, or actions it can see and perform.  
 • For each UI element, consult this metadata at runtime to determine visibility and enablement.  
 • Keep criteria in one place (e.g., a JSON/DB file), eliminating repetitive if-else blocks across the codebase.  
-• This ensures minimal branching, preserves flexibility for future role additions, and localizes the role-based logic for easy maintenance.
