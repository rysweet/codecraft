bootstrap_spec_dialog.py (v0.7)
--------------------------------
A Spec-First Two-Persona Dialog Tool for Refining Markdown Specifications

This script accelerates the creation and refinement of software specs by orchestrating a structured
conversation between two roles:
  • PM-Interviewer: probes the current spec with focused questions.
  • Architect-Responder: provides concise, well-defined technical guidance.

Features:
  - Manual Mode (default): one-turn PM question followed by your architect answer and automated patch.
  - Auto Mode (`--auto`): runs configurable cycles of PM⇄Architect exchanges and applies diffs.
  - Prompt Management: all system prompts live in `src/prompts/` via prompty.ai for easy customization.
  - Patch Pipeline: attempts direct diff apply, context-smart insert, and a pending-updates fallback.
  - Azure OpenAI Integration: uses `AzureOpenAI` client with DefaultAzureCredential for token-based auth.
  - Local-First Workflow: edits local Markdown spec files, supports safe rollbacks and manual overrides.
  - Self-Rebuild (`--rebuild`): regenerate bootstrap.py from its own specification and docstrings.
  - Self-Improve (`--improve`): run iterative self-improvement cycles refining specification and code.

Backlog Goals:
  1. Evolve specs through dialogue-driven refinement.
  2. Ensure reliable patching with robust failure recovery.
  3. Keep prompts and logic modular for future extensions.
  4. Provide transparent audit trails of spec changes.

Environment Variables:
  - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
  - AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT
  - AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION

CLI Flags:
  - --auto                 Run automatic PM⇄Architect cycles
  - --turns <n> (default 4) Number of auto mode turns
  - --rebuild              Regenerate this tool's code from its spec and docstrings
  - --improve              Run self-improvement cycles on the bootstrap specification
